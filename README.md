# MERN Stack User Authentication Project

## Overview
This project is a demonstration of user authentication using the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. It allows users to register, log in, log out, and access protected routes.

## Features
- User registration: Allows users to sign up by providing a unique username and password.
- User login: Enables users to log in using their registered credentials.
- Authentication middleware: Protects routes that require authentication.
- Session management: Utilizes session-based authentication for maintaining user sessions.
- Logout functionality: Allows users to log out and end their current session.

## Technologies Used
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store user information securely.
- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js used to build the backend server.
- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces used to create the frontend.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used for running server-side code.
- bcrypt.js: A library used for hashing passwords securely.
- Express Session: Middleware used for managing sessions in Express.js.
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Used for generating and validating authentication tokens.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend:
   ```
   cd client
   npm install
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up your MongoDB database and configure the connection URI in `server/config/db.js`.
4. Run the backend server:
   ```
   cd server
   npm start
   ```
5. Run the frontend development server:
   ```
   cd client
   npm start
   ```
6. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
- Register a new user by providing a unique username and password.
- Log in using your registered credentials.
- Access protected routes such as profile or dashboard pages.
- Log out to end your current session.
